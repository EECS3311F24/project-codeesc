## ***Welcome to the README.MD of CodeEsc!***

### The Motivation:


CodeEsc is a project motivated by a group of contributors who love puzzle solving with a competitive aspect to it.  CodeEsc is a puzzle solving desktop application that was made to be played like a game from any PC that downloads it, it is a lightweight application that requires a computer just strong enough to run modern web pages on their browser! 

CodeEsc features levels where you have to escape the room you are put into as fast as you can! Look around the room for items which you can interact with and read about while being timed for your speed. Not only is it a fun challenge for your brain, there is also a competitive aspect to it as once you are finished your run, you can submit it to the leaderboards to see how other people did on their first try!

This project is powered by Java while using the Java Swing library and JDBC to connect to our hosted MySql database. No matter where you complete our Escape Room puzzles from, you can be sure youâ€™re always connected to the leaderboards if you want to compete.
