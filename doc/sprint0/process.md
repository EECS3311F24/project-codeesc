# **Process Reflection for CodeESC Team**

### Team Organization: Our team is organized into specific roles to enhance efficiency and accountability
•	**Project Manager:** Oversees the overall progress and ensures deadlines are met.

•	**Developers:** Responsible for coding the features and fixing bugs.

•	**Tester:** Focuses on quality assurance, conducting tests and reporting issues.

•	**Designer**: Handles the UI/UX aspects, ensuring the game is visually engaging.

### Tools Used
•	**GitHub:** For version control, collaborative coding, and managing pull requests.

•	**Trello:** To track user stories, tasks, and progress within the project.

•	**Discord:** For real-time communication and quick updates among team members.

•	**Zoom:** For our bi-weekly meetings and discussions.



### **Decision Making** 
Decisions within our team are made collaboratively. We hold discussions during our meetings where all members contribute their opinions. If a consensus isn’t reached, we use a voting system where each member can cast their vote. Major decisions, such as feature implementation, require unanimous consent.



### Prioritizing User Stories 
•	 User demand (based on feedback or surveys)

•	 Technical feasibility

•	 Contribution to the overall game experience

We typically need one round of voting to establish priorities, although contentious issues may require a second round of discussion.



### Meetings 
Our team meets bi-weekly to discuss progress, challenges, and upcoming tasks. During these meetings, we review completed user stories and adjust our plans as necessary. Additionally, we have informal check-ins through discord to facilitate ongoing communication.



### Next Phase 
Moving forward, we aim to improve our communication strategies to ensure that all team members are aligned on project goals. We plan to implement a project management tool to track user stories and tasks more efficiently, ensuring accountability and transparency in our workflow.
