# **Process Reflection for CodeESC Team**

### Team Organization: Our team is organized into specific roles to enhance efficiency and accountability
•	**Project Manager:** This individual oversees the overall progress of the project, ensuring that deadlines are met and the team stays on track. They facilitate meetings, coordinate tasks, and act as the main point of contact for any external communication.

•	**Developers:** Responsible for coding the features, fixing bugs, and ensuring that the software is functioning as intended. Each developer has specific user stories assigned based on their strengths, ensuring that the workload is balanced and aligned with team skills.

•	**Tester:** Focuses on quality assurance, conducting thorough testing of the application to identify and report issues. They create test cases based on user stories and ensure that the application meets the defined acceptance criteria before any features are marked as done.

•	**Designer**: Handles the UI/UX aspects of the game, ensuring that it is visually engaging and user-friendly. This includes designing interfaces, creating assets, and ensuring that the game provides a seamless experience for users.

### Tools Used
•	**GitHub:** For version control, collaborative coding, and managing pull requests.

•	**Trello:** To track user stories, tasks, and progress within the project.

•	**Discord:** For real-time communication and quick updates among team members.

•	**Zoom:** For our bi-weekly meetings and discussions.



### **Decision Making** 
Decisions within our team are made collaboratively. We hold discussions during our meetings where all members contribute their opinions. For significant decisions, such as feature implementation or changes in project direction, we use a voting system where each member can cast their vote. This democratic approach ensures that everyone has a voice in the decision-making process. In cases where consensus isn’t reached, we encourage further discussion to understand differing viewpoints before re-voting.



### Prioritizing User Stories 
•	 **User demand (based on feedback or surveys):** We actively gather feedback from potential users through surveys or discussions to understand which features they value most.

•	 **Technical feasibility:** We assess the complexity and time required to implement each user story, ensuring that we can realistically deliver within our timeline.

•	 **Contribution to the overall game experience:** Features that significantly enhance gameplay or improve user engagement are given higher priority.

We typically need one round of voting to establish priorities, although contentious issues may require a second round of discussion.



### Meetings 
Our team meets bi-weekly to discuss progress, challenges, and upcoming tasks. These meetings serve as a checkpoint to ensure everyone is aligned and aware of what others are working on. We also review completed user stories and adjust our plans as necessary based on progress made. Additionally, we have informal check-ins through Discord for ongoing communication, allowing team members to ask questions and share quick updates without waiting for the next scheduled meeting.


### Next Phase 
Moving forward, we aim to improve our communication strategies to ensure that all team members are aligned on project goals. We plan to implement a dedicated project management tool that integrates with GitHub, enabling us to link code commits directly to user stories and tasks. This will provide better visibility into progress and accountability for each feature. Additionally, we will focus on refining our testing processes to ensure high-quality releases, allowing us to respond more effectively to user feedback and enhance the overall gameplay experience.
