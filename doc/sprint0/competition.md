## Competition:

Due to the unique nature of CodeEsc, the competitors of the project are quite far and yet there exists some of them. Most of the other existing products that would be competitors are games that have been published on the platform Steam.

These are all products that solve a very similar or almost exact same problem as our product CodeEsc, by providing a digital Escape Room experience for entertainment purposes.

## How is our product different?

There is one fundamental difference between these products and ours however, and that is the main selling point of these games. These games/products I have listed above provide an immersive escape room experience by having great design and graphics with full on game engines and 3D design.

Our product is very different as CodeEsc was not only designed to provide an Escape Room puzzle experience digitally, it was also designed to be more competitive with the focus on a leaderboard system for completing levels fast and really getting its users a competitive experience, which is something our main competitors listed above did not put in consideration when designing their products.

The tradeoff however, is that our graphics are very simple and are displayed in a 2D matter. This shows that while our other competitors have better graphics and an atmosphere, they have no competitive aspect to their products while CodeEsc is a project that focuses on the complete opposite.
<br>

## For which users and scenarios is our product better for?

Our product CodeEsc is better for users who want to enjoy solving puzzles while also enjoying a timed competitive aspect to it. While our product may not provide the best graphics, as mentioned before it provides a different more “speedrun puzzle” type of experience.

A scenario this product could be used for is a group of friends seeing who can complete puzzles faster in a little competition, something our competitors do not offer.
<br>

## Who are our users and what are the scenarios?

Our users, as mentioned a few times above, are people who are looking for a competitive puzzle experience, users who want to solve those puzzles in an Escape Room theme digitally. Our scenarios would include competitions between different users for such cases.

## Why did our competitors not focus on our users and scenarios?

There’s a very specific reason that our competitors did not focus on the users and scenarios that our project is targeting. It is clear by viewing any of our competitors that what they wanted to do is to bring a deep, graphical, and immersive Escape Room experience that mimics what a user would get if they went to an Escape Room in person and not digitally through their computer.
 
While this is quite enjoyable as well, it lacks the competitive aspect that our project implements which is a large part of our target users and scenarios, something that our competitors completely lack. If they wanted to focus on our users and scenarios, they would have to implement competitive features to their products such as the one we have, a timed run system on all the levels they feature in their Escape Rooms.
