## Sprint Goal
The primary objective for Sprint 2 is to enhance gameplay mechanics, integrate the timer feature, and implement level transitions. These updates aim to improve the game's core functionality and user experience, ensuring readiness for testing and the sprint demo.

## User Stories for Sprint 1
This sprint will focus on the development, integration, and initial testing of the following key user stories derived from the Release Planning Meeting:

### User Story: 1. Gameplay
Description:
As a player, I want to experience engaging gameplay, so that I can enjoy the game.
Tasks:
Implement gameplay mechanics, such as interacting with objects and puzzles.
Acceptance Criteria:
The game allows players to interact with objects in a consistent and responsive manner.
Gameplay mechanics such as object interaction, puzzle solving, and movements are functional.

  

### User Story: 2. Timer Feature
Description:
As a player, I want to have a timer during gameplay, so that I can track how long it takes me to complete puzzles.
Tasks:
Integrate a timer system into gameplay.
Acceptance Criteria:
A visible timer is present during gameplay that accurately tracks the time spent on each puzzle from start to finish.
The timer starts and stops correctly at the beginning and end of each level or upon game pause/resume actions.


### User Story: 3. Progress Through Levels
Description:
As a player, I want to progress through multiple levels, so that I can challenge myself.
Tasks:
Design different level content.
Integrate level transition logic.
Acceptance Criteria:
Players can progress from one level to the next after completing the required objectives without any disruptions or errors.
Level transitions include a clear indication of progression (e.g., a completion screen, level summary) and load within acceptable time limits.


## Team Capacity
For Sprint 1, 1 story point is equivalent to 4 hours of work contributed to a task, it should not exceed 6 points, longer than 6 points should be broken down into smaller tasks. Therefore, the team's total available capacity amounts to 11 points which is equivalent 44 hours of work being done in this sprint. This is based on individual member availability as follows:

- **Max Toong**: 2 points(8 hours) 
- **Rizan Bhanwadia**: 2 points(8 hours) 
- **Badra Elmi**: 3 points(12 hours)
- **Ilya Orin**: 3 points(12 hours)
- **Saina Shishegar**: 3 points(12 hours)

Given this capacity, the team will prioritize essential tasks and features to align with our sprint goal while ensuring realistic workloads and timelines.
